# Weather-App



## Description

This is a simple and interactive weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from a third-party API and displays it to the user. Users can search for the weather in any city, and the application will show the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description.



## Features

*Search Functionality:* Users can type a city name into the search bar to get the current weather conditions for that location.

*API Integration:* The application uses a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch up-to-date weather information.

*Dynamic UI:* The user interface updates dynamically to display the retrieved weather data.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
Error Handling: The application handles errors gracefully (e.g., displaying a message if an invalid city name is entered).



## Technologies Used

*HTML:* For the basic structure and layout of the app.

*CSS:* For styling, including typography, colors, and layout.

*JavaScript:* For handling user input, making API calls, and dynamically updating the content.

*Weather API:* To provide the weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com).
